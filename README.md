# Trial-vs-Control_Stores-Sales-Impact-Analysis
🛒 Retail Uplift Analysis

This project explores how a redesigned store layout influenced chip sales across a major grocery chain. By leveraging uplift modeling, A/B testing, and real transaction data, I quantified the layout's effectiveness and delivered data-driven recommendations to support strategic business decisions.

📌 Objectives

Measure the impact of a new layout strategy using historical sales data
Perform control vs. trial group analysis using experimental design techniques
Apply customer segmentation using clustering and demographic data enrichment
Translate data analysis into actionable insights for business intelligence
