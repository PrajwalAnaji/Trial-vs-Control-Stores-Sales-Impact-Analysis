<hr style="height:1px; border:none; background-color:#ccc;">

## 🛍️ Retail Uplift Analysis

This project explores how a redesigned store layout influenced **chip sales** across a major grocery chain.  
By leveraging **uplift modeling**, **A/B testing**, and **real transaction data**, I quantified the layout's effectiveness and delivered data-driven recommendations to support strategic business decisions.

## 📌 Objectives

- Measure the impact of a new layout strategy using historical sales data.
- Perform control vs. trial group analysis using experimental design techniques.
- Apply customer segmentation using clustering and demographic data enrichment.
- Translate data analysis into actionable insights for business intelligence and decision-making.
